# Security Implementation Checklist

## Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] Validate all user inputs with schema validation (Zod, Joi)
- [ ] Sanitize HTML content to prevent XSS
- [ ] Reject oversized payloads (>10MB default)
- [ ] Validate file types and sizes for uploads
- [ ] Use allowlists instead of blocklists for validation

## Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Use secure password hashing (bcrypt with cost factor 12+)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login attempts
- [ ] Require HTTPS/TLS for all connections
- [ ] Use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies
- [ ] Implement JWT expiration and refresh token rotation

## Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS/TLS 1.2+)
- [ ] Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- [ ] Implement field-level access control
- [ ] Mask PII in logs
- [ ] Regular database backups with encryption

## API Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting per IP and per user
- [ ] Validate content-type headers
- [ ] Implement CORS with specific allowed origins
- [ ] Use CSRF tokens for state-changing requests
- [ ] Add request signing for critical operations

## Dependency Management
- [ ] Run `npm audit` regularly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly (at minimum)
- [ ] Review dependency licenses
- [ ] Use lockfile (package-lock.json)
- [ ] Scan with security tools (Snyk, WhiteSource)

## Secrets Management
- [ ] Use .env files (never commit to git)
- [ ] Use different secrets for dev/staging/production
- [ ] Rotate secrets regularly (at least quarterly)
- [ ] Use secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)
